# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer using to display and compare the time it takes to sort around 50 bars. The 4 sorting algorithms I am comparing are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort. I am using Raylib C++ Library to practice drawing and updating graphics and using C++ and Visual Studio to write out the project. My goal for this project is to write the code in parallel using multithreading and allowing all 4 algorithms to display at the same times for comparison. I would hope this project to be useful for people who would like to visualize these common sorting algorithms and be abkle to witness the difference and time comparisons between the algorithms.
