# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer using to display and compare the time it takes to sort around 50 bars. The 4 sorting algorithms I am comparing are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort. I am using Raylib C++ Library to practice drawing and updating graphics and using C++ and Visual Studio to write out the project. My goal for this project is to write the code in parallel using multithreading and allowing all 4 algorithms to display at the same times for comparison. I would hope this project to be useful for people who would like to visualize these common sorting algorithms and be abkle to witness the difference and time comparisons between the algorithms.

At the end of the project, I was content with how it turned out and how quickly I could implement everything. The main goal was to understand the Raylib library and it was fairly easy to use. The hardest issue
I had was implementing threads and figuring out a way to display the 4 algorithms and to do the algorithms at the same time. With a lot of trial and error, I was able to find an easy way to make the multithreading to work for the algortihms.
