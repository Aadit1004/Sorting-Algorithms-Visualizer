# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer using to display and compare the time it takes to sort around 70 bars. The 4 sorting algorithms I am comparing are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. I am using Raylib C++ Library to practice drawing and updating graphics and using C++ and Visual Studio to write out the project.
